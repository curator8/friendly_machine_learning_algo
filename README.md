# friendly_machine_learning_algo
my career goal is to become a machine learning engineer so this repository is dedicated to that learning path. These notebook (or really workbooks) are created from attending and watching lecture at my college course with Dr. Wu for Machine Learning and Jose Portilla Udemy Course on Python for Data Science and Machine Learning.
